This project's purpose is to test the things I've learned in the HTML foundation section of The Odin Project foundations course. This project will be a simple website made using just the basics of HTML. 

The skills im aiming to test are:
- Correct usage of various elements
- Making a standard boilerplate
- Creating working links while applying some security basics
- Correct use of imagery by giving all necessary attribiutes
- Proper organisation of files
- Good commits
