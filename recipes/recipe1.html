    <h1>Chicken with black beans and quinoa</h1>
    <img src="../pictures/dinner.webp" alt="Picture of recipe">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is what I typically have for dinner. Quinoa again I know, to me it's like rice but better.
        Since I already eat a red type meat for lunch I like to eat chicken for dinner. Since chicken by itself is kind of bland
        and the rest of the meal isn't that flavour rich either i try to spice it up with some salt and pepper. The meal
        is nutritional, it's easy to make, I like it. I usually cook at mass so this is enough for 2 people or prep for 2 days</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g quinoa</li>
        <li>300g chicken (2 pieces of 150g)</li>
        <li>400g beans (canned value)</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Get the 2 pieces of chicken and make a large slice on the sides to fold them open to increase their surface area</li>
        <li>Get 1 tablespoon of ovila oil and cover the 2 pieces of chicken in it</li>
        <li>Cover the 2 pieces of chicken in salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Put the 2 pieces in a pan, put on a lid and cook them on a low to medium fire</li>
        <li>Flip both pieces from time to time until both sides start to get a litte brown then turn off the fire</li>
        <li>Cook 400ml hot water until it starts boiling</li>
        <li>Add in the quinoa and let it cook on a low fire for 12 minutes</li>
        <li>Put the black beens from the can straight into the pan and let it cook for 3-4 minutes on a low to medium fire</li>
        <li>Enjoy food!</li>
    </ol>
